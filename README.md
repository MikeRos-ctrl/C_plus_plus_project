# C_plus_plus_project
My First C++ Project

Welcome to this section!!
Thanks for taking the time to read this.

This was my first c++ project, even though it's pretty rusty, it was developed using visual studio 2017, which means some libraries i used are not working (like pch.h). in vs 2019
I'll say i had lot of fun and dozens of stress!!
As my first college project you see that some of my logic it's pretty "rusty", i had probably complicated myself in a lots of ways.

Basically, it was a laundry in which i had to register every ticket, cost of services and so on.

Knoledge: the basics(validations,funtions, variable types, pointers, for, do while, etc)
          pretty much the basics of c++.
